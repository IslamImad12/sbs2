        <h2>How to Begin Implementing IoT Sensors in Real Estate and Facility Management</h2>
        <p>
        Integrating IoT sensors into corporate real estate (CRE) and facility management (FM) provides numerous benefits for enhancing workplace efficiency and productivity. Real-time data from these sensors delivers valuable insights into building occupancy, temperature, indoor air quality, and energy consumption. This information enables CRE and FM professionals to optimize building performance, boost energy efficiency, and create a more comfortable environment for occupants.
        </p>
        <p>
        Leveraging IoT-enabled energy monitoring allows organizations to make data-driven decisions, implement targeted energy-saving measures, and demonstrate their commitment to sustainability. Additionally, IoT sensors support various workplace applications, including smart room and desk booking, asset and equipment tracking, space planning, and smart cleaning. These applications streamline processes, improve resource utilization, and enhance the overall workplace experience.
        </p>
        <p>
        However, whether you are just beginning to adopt IoT sensors or considering expanding their use, it is important to be aware of some challenges and limitations.
